# Rotate-around-active
active object as a new referential   


* new referential around active object   
  on:   
    -active object only   
    -selected objects  
    -whole scene  
  
working on parents object with their childen   
but not children directly, which is logic because their coordinates are bases on parents one. 

* added cursor as new referential 
  - for the moment working on one object I have to finish to all selected  
  - snap to face rather than volume later

I you see possible improvements you are WELCOME
